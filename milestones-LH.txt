Summary
This challenge went fairly well. It was a bit difficult at first to set goals for everyone, but once we had our minds set on
a more clear end goal, we were able to break the work apart into parts for each of us to accomplish. It was also quite fascinating
learning more about Python, as I have heard about it countless times, but not put much time into it until now.
